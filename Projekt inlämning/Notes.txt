Some notes regarding the project.


Programming:
I have been using DirectSound to program the Sound in to my existing 3D-project.
I have added three sounds where they change volume based on the distance between the camera and the object.
The SoundManager uses one PrimaryBuffer and several SecondaryBuffers. 
Where each sound is loaded into a separate SecondaryBuffer.
Then when the program play one or several SecondaryBuffers they mix together to the PrimaryBuffer which plays the sound to the sound card.


Video:
The video shows three cars who each have a separate sound. The further away from a car the quieter the sound will be.
The video starts on the middle one who have a asian music sound playing. It pans backwards a bit to show that the sounds gets quieter the further away the camera is.
After that the video pans to the upper right car which have a windy sound. (Smokebomb taken from the large game project).
It then go back and goes to the last car (down left car) which have a bird voice playing.
Lastly the camera pans back far away so the whole program becomes quiet.
